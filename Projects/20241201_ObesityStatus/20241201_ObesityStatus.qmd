I worked with a team of students to model various health measures to try to predict the obesity status of an individual. The data was not clean: It was missing about 8% of the values in each predictor, so we ran 3 separate imputation techniques on it: Amelia (multiple imputation; efficient), mice (multiple imputation; slowish), and missForest (single imputation; very slow â€” I forgot to have it update me on progress and thought my computer had crashed!).

We then ran several different models on each imputed data set: random forest, logistic regression, KNN, and principal-component discriminant analysis. (The last one was my invention and struggled mightily with this data.) We saw the best results from a random forest model using the missForest-imputed data, which correctly classified all but 5 of the more than 30,000 observations correctly.
