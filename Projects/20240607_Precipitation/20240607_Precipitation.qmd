I fitted advanced time series models to precipitation totals data at BWI airport. Models used included ARIMA, ARCH, ETS, Holt-Winters, Neural-Net Auto Regression, Prophet, and a somewhat over-optimized combined-fit model. 

I then forecasted the data 2 years out, showing a dampened version of the trend perceived in the data.
