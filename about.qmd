title: "About"
---

I am a native of Washington, DC, but have spent the past four years basking in the sunny weather of Los Angeles.

I have a strong background in R, having been trained in the Tidyverse packages (although I am firmly of the belief that base R plots are just nicer looking than ggplots) and am very familiar with working with time series in R. I also have a foundation in Python, can code in C++, can bash around in SQL (preferred pronunciation order: "Squeal", "Sequel", "S-Q-L"), and at this point have probably produced more content in Latex than should strictly be considered healthy.

In terms of spoken languages, I can understand Portuguese fluently (and even speak it to an extent), have a decent grasp of Spanish, and a beginner's level of German (up to the Goethe A2 certificate).

In my — at this point rather limited — free time, I like to run, backpack, and read: I am currently working my way through John Le Carré's George Smiley series (as of this update, halfway through the tomic *Honorable Schoolboy*).
