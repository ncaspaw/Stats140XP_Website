title: "About"
---

I am a native of Washington, DC, but have spent the past four years basking in the sunny weather of Los Angeles. 

I have a strong background in R, having been trained in the Tidyverse packages (although I am firmly of the belief that base R plots are just nicer looking than ggplots) and am very familiar with working with time series in R. I also have a foundation in Python and can code in C++.

In terms of spoken languages, I can understand Portuguese fluently (and even speak it to an extent), have a decent grasp of Spanish, and a beginner's level of German (up to the Goethe A2 certificate).

In my — at this point rather limited — free time, I like to run, backpack, and read: I am currently working my way through John Le Carré's George Smiley series.
