title: "About Me"
---

I am a native of Washington, DC, but have spent the past four years calling sunny Los Angeles home while exploring the world through hiking trails and data alike.

I have a strong background in R, having been trained in the Tidyverse packages — although I find base R plots more *aes*thetically pleasing than ggplots — and am very familiar with working with time series in R. I also have a foundation in Python, can code in C++, bash around in SQL (preferred pronunciation order: "Squeal", "Sequel", "S-Q-L"), and at this point have probably produced more content in Latex than should strictly be considered healthy.

In terms of spoken languages, I can understand Portuguese fluently (and even speak it to an extent), have a decent grasp of Spanish, and a beginner's level of German (up to the Goethe A2 certificate).

In my — currently rather limited — free time, I like to run, backpack, and read: I have recently finished reading John Le Carré's George Smiley series (I currently am reading *Karla's Choice*, the novel written by his son to fill in the gap between *The Spy Who Came in from the Cold* and *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*, which I have found to be very interesting — and so far a lot less about Karla than I would have expected, given the title).
