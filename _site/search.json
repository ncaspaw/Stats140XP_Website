    "text": "I am a native of Washington, DC, but have spent the past four years basking in the sunny weather of Los Angeles.\nI have a strong background in R, having been trained in the Tidyverse packages (although I am firmly of the belief that base R plots are just nicer looking than ggplots) and strong familiarity with working with time series in R. I also have a foundation in Python and can code in C++.\nIn terms of spoken languages, I can understand Portuguese fluently (and even speak it to an extent), have a decent grasp of Spanish, and a beginner’s level of German (up to the Goethe A2 certificate).\nIn my — at this point rather limited — free time, I like to run, backpack, and read: I am currently working my way through John Le Carré’s George Smiley series.\n\n\n\nBackpacking in Santa Fe"

    "text": "I worked with a team of students to model various health measures to try to predict the obesity status of an individual. The data was not clean: it was missing about 8% of the values in each predictor, so we ran 3 separate imputation techniques on it: Amelia (multiple imputation; efficient), mice (multiple imputation; slowish), and missForest (single imputation; very slow — I forgot to have it update me on progress and thought my computer had crashed!).\nWe then ran several different models on each imputed data set: random forest, logistic regression, KNN, and principal-component discriminant analysis. (The last one was my invention and struggled mightily with this data.) We saw the best results from a random forest model using the missForest-imputed data, which correctly classified all but 5 of the more than 30,000 observations correctly.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about this project, read our full report here."

It was unclear whether our experiment was flawed, caffeine actually has no impact on the functions we tested, or if the Islanders were programmed to not be affected by caffeine in this way.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about this project, read our full report here."
