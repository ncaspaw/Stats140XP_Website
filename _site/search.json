    "text": "I am a native of Washington, DC, but have spent the past four years basking in the sunny weather of Los Angeles.\nI have a strong background in R, having been trained in the Tidyverse packages (although I am firmly of the belief that base R plots are just nicer looking than ggplots) and strong familiarity with working with time series in R. I also have a foundation in Python and can code in C++.\nIn terms of spoken languages, I can understand Portuguese fluently (and even speak it to an extent), have a decent grasp of Spanish, and a beginner’s level of German (up to the Goethe A2 certificate).\nIn my — at this point rather limited — free time, I like to run, backpack, and read: I am currently working my way through John Le Carré’s George Smiley series.\n\n\n\nBackpacking in Santa Fe"
