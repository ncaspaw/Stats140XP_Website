As part of a game theory course, I prepared a model of free riding in a military alliance. I created a payoff function for agents to invest a certain amount of money in the outcome of a war, grounding the costs in terms of real world motivators (both the financial incentive and a more opaque outcomes incentive). I then attempted to solve the model, but the math was too complicated and I got bogged down in a recursive differential equation. This led to an attempt to run a Monte Carlo simulation of the model, which unfortunately was also unsuccessful. A write up of the model can be found [here](202405_FreeRidingInAMilitaryAlliance_Theory.pdf).
